/**
 * An unmodifiable view on an {@link ItemStack}.
 * <p>
 * This interface mirrors (most of) the read-only methods of {@link ItemStack}. Implementations are
 * expected to delegate these methods to an underlying item stack.
 * <p>
 * Although this interface does not allow the modification of the underlying item stack, any
 * modifications to the underlying item stack by other means are dynamically reflected by the
 * methods of this interface.
 * <p>
 * In order to avoid accidentally passing unmodifiable item stacks to code that is not aware that
 * the item stack cannot be modified, the API always exposes unmodifiable item stacks via this
 * interface. Users of the API should not rely on whether the implementation of this interface
 * extends {@link ItemStack}. If an {@link ItemStack} view of this unmodifiable item stack is
 * required, use either {@link #copy()} to create a normal modifiable item stack copy with the same
 * item data, or the less safe {@link #asItemStack()} (see its documentation for notes about its
 * limitations).
 * <p>
 * The API uses this interface for at least two optimization purposes: Exposing unmodifiable views
 * on internal immutable item stacks without having to copy them first. And as an indicator whether
 * an item stack passed as argument to a method can be assumed to be immutable and does therefore
 * not require to be additionally copied before being internally stored. Methods that make use of
 * this second aspect are expected to clarify this in their documentation. It is unsafe to pass an
 * {@link #asItemStack() ItemStack view} of an unmodifiable item stack to a method that does not
 * explicitly state that it supports unmodifiable item stacks.
 * <p>
 * {@link #equals(Object)} compares two {@link UnmodifiableItemStack}s based on their underlying
 * item stacks, but can also be used to compare the {@link UnmodifiableItemStack} directly to a
 * normal {@link ItemStack}. However, for some types of {@link ItemStack} this comparison may not be
 * symmetrical. See {@link #equals(Object)} for more information on this limitation.
 * <p>
 * {@link #serialize()} is a read-only operation that delegates to {@link ItemStack#serialize()} of
 * the underlying item stack. In order to be able to directly serialize the underlying item stack
 * with Bukkit's configuration serialization API, without having to wrap this
 * {@link UnmodifiableItemStack} in another serializable container, manually invoking
 * {@link #serialize()}, or first creating a copy of the underlying item stack, this interface
 * extends {@link ConfigurationSerializable}. However, both the serialization and deserialization of
 * this type delegate to {@link ItemStack}. Consequently, an {@link UnmodifiableItemStack} is
 * serialized like a normal item stack and ends up being deserialized as a normal modifiable
 * {@link ItemStack}.

	 * This is not the same as {@link #copy()}, nor does this return the underlying item stack
	 * itself. Instead, this returns an {@link ItemStack} whose implementation delegates its
	 * read-only methods to the underlying item stack and throws an
	 * {@link UnsupportedOperationException} for any methods that would usually modify the item
	 * stack.
	 * <p>
	 * The returned item stack has several limitations that make it unsafe to be used as a
	 * substitute for normal item stacks in general:
	 * <ul>
	 * <li>The primary purpose of this method is to be able to pass an unmodifiable item stack to
	 * methods that require an {@link ItemStack} and that do not modify the item stack, without
	 * having to copy the item stack first. An example use case are utility methods that would
	 * otherwise need to be duplicated in order to work with both {@link ItemStack} and
	 * {@link UnmodifiableItemStack}. Another use case are Bukkit API methods that are known to
	 * internally copy the passed item stack anyway. However, one has to be extremely careful to not
	 * accidentally pass the returned item stack to methods that might then attempt to modify it, or
	 * invoke unsupported methods on it.
	 * <li>The returned item stack is only guaranteed to support the operations that are also listed
	 * in this interface. Some server implementations extend the Bukkit API and add methods to
	 * {@link ItemStack}. These methods, even if they appear to be read-only, may not be supported
	 * by the returned item stack. Using them can result in exceptions or undefined behavior during
	 * runtime.
	 * <li>CraftBukkit's {@code CraftItemStack} implementation does not account for custom
	 * {@link ItemStack} implementations: Its implementation of
	 * {@link ItemStack#isSimilar(ItemStack)} and {@link ItemStack#equals(Object)} will never
	 * consider the item stacks returned by this method to be equal to itself, even if all the item
	 * stack data matches. Consequently, it is therefore not possible for the returned item stack to
	 * implement {@link #isSimilar(ItemStack)} and {@link #equals(Object)} without violating the
	 * symmetry requirement for at least {@code CraftItemStack}s.<br>
	 * However, instead of blocking these methods from being usable at all, or limited to
	 * comparisons with Bukkit's {@link ItemStack}, both of which wouldn't resolve the issue either
	 * because the comparisons can still silently fail without warning when performed in the
	 * opposite direction, they will work fine as long as the comparison is done with the
	 * unmodifiable item stack as the left operator and the {@code CraftItemStack} as the right
	 * operator. However, users of this method have to be extremely careful about this aspect.
	 * </ul>
	 * <p>
	 * The returned item stack implements {@link UnmodifiableItemStack}. Methods that receive an
	 * {@link ItemStack} can therefore check whether the item stack is unmodifiable by checking if
	 * it is an instance of {@link UnmodifiableItemStack}.
	 * <p>
	 * Implementations of {@link UnmodifiableItemStack} may choose to extend {@link ItemStack} and
	 * then return themselves as the result of this method. However, users of this method should not
	 * rely on this to be the case.
	 * 
	 * @return an {@link ItemStack} view on this unmodifiable item stack
	 * @deprecated Using this method comes with certain risks. This method is marked as deprecated
	 *             in order to make it less convenient to use and thereby make developers aware of
	 *             its limitations. If these limitations turn out to be too severe, or if future
	 *             Bukkit changes make it difficulty to support this method with reasonable effort,
	 *             this method may also be removed again without notice.
